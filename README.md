## Useful Info

For iOS builds, sometimes after updating pods, environment needs to be updated to point to
the latest gems, and might need to run:
  export PATH="/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/bin:$PATH"

To build iOS release, run:
```
flutter build ios
```
To build iOS debug, run:
```
flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign
```
